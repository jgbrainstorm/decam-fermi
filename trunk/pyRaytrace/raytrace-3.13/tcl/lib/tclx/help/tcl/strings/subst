NAME
       subst - Perform backslash, command, and variable substitutions

SYNOPSIS
       subst ?-nobackslashes? ?-nocommands? ?-novariables? string


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  performs  variable substitutions, command substitutions,
       and backslash substitutions on its  string  argument  and  returns  the
       fully-substituted  result.   The substitutions are performed in exactly
       the same way as for Tcl commands.  As a result, the string argument  is
       actually substituted twice, once by the Tcl parser in the usual fashion
       for Tcl commands, and again by the subst command.

       If any of the -nobackslashes, -nocommands, or -novariables  are  speci-
       fied,  then  the  corresponding  substitutions  are not performed.  For
       example, if -nocommands is specified, no command substitution  is  per-
       formed:   open  and  close  brackets are treated as ordinary characters
       with no special interpretation.

       Note: when it performs its substitutions, subst does not give any  spe-
       cial  treatment  to  double  quotes  or curly braces.  For example, the
       script
              set a 44
              subst {xyz {$a}}
       returns ‘‘xyz {44}’’, not ‘‘xyz {$a}’’.

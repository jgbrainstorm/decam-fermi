NAME
       append - Append to variable

SYNOPSIS
       append varName ?value value value ...?


DESCRIPTION
       Append all of the value arguments to the current value of variable var-
       Name.  If varName doesn’t exist, it is given a value equal to the  con-
       catenation  of all the value arguments.  This command provides an effi-
       cient way to build  up  long  variables  incrementally.   For  example,
       ‘‘append  a  $b’’  is  much more efficient than ‘‘set a $a$b’’ if $a is
       long.

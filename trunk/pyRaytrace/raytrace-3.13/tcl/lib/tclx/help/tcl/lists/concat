NAME
       concat - Join lists together

SYNOPSIS
       concat ?arg arg ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  command treats each argument as a list and concatenates them into
       a single list.  It also eliminates leading and trailing spaces  in  the
       arg’s  and adds a single separator space between arg’s.  It permits any
       number of arguments.  For example, the command
              concat a b {c d e} {f {g h}}
       will return
              a b c d e f {g h}
       as its result.

       If no args are supplied, the result is an empty string.

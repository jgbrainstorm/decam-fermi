NAME
       lindex - Retrieve an element from a list

SYNOPSIS
       lindex list index


DESCRIPTION
       This command treats list as a Tcl list and returns the indexâ€™th element
       from it (0 refers to the first element of the list).  In extracting the
       element,  lindex  observes  the same rules concerning braces and quotes
       and backslashes as the Tcl command interpreter; however, variable  sub-
       stitution  and command substitution do not occur.  If index is negative
       or greater than or equal to the number of elements in  value,  then  an
       empty string is returned.  If index has the value end, it refers to the
       last element in the list, and end-integer refers to the last element in
       the list minus the specified integer offset.

This is a python package for analyzing the images taken by the Dark Energy Survey Camera at Fermilab and elsewhere. It is modified from another package, fmccd, which is used for the Multi CCD testing vessel at Fermilab for the DECam. As there are many changes for the conventions of the images, the current package is used exclusively for the final image convention of the DECam, though some of the routines may also be used to other tasks.
